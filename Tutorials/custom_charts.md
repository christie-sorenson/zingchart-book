# Custom Charts

So you’ve decided to buy ZingChart and make our charts part of your app or website. Congratulations! Now we can help you take your custom charts to the next level. We’re sharing information on how to make your charts match your company’s branding even more closely.


ZingChart offers granular styling for nearly every chart element. This allows you to customize charts in very detailed ways. For example, you can match colors and other branding elements from your company. Our JSON syntax does a great job of laying out exactly what can be customized and how, in terms of chart elements.

But ZingChart allows more customization beyond colors and sizing.

### Watermark


The ZingChart logo appears as a watermark at the bottom-right corner of our charts. It appears by default on all unlicensed charts when loaded into the web browser.
